# 🚀 Railway CDE Port Fix - Deployment Guide

## ✅ **Problem SOLVED**

Your Railway CDE was failing because:
1. **Incorrect Port Binding**: Railway requires `0.0.0.0:$PORT` not `localhost:8080`
2. **Missing Health Checks**: No verification that internal MCP services started properly
3. **Poor Error Handling**: No graceful degradation when services fail

## 🛠️ **Applied Fixes**

### **1. Fixed Dockerfile.railway**
- ✅ Added `netcat-openbsd` for health checks
- ✅ Uses fixed startup script
- ✅ Proper Railway PORT environment handling

### **2. Enhanced start-railway.sh**
- ✅ **Railway Port Detection**: `${PORT:-8080}` with fallback
- ✅ **Service Health Checks**: Verifies each MCP service starts
- ✅ **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper signal handling
- ✅ **Better Logging**: Clear startup progress indicators

### **3. Railway-Optimized Gateway (server-railway-fixed.js)**
- ✅ **Correct Binding**: `0.0.0.0:$PORT` instead of `localhost`
- ✅ **Enhanced Health Endpoint**: Shows service status + Railway environment
- ✅ **Better Error Handling**: Clear error messages for debugging
- ✅ **Railway Environment Detection**: Logs Railway-specific info

## 🚄 **Railway Deployment Steps**

### **Option A: Redeploy from GitHub**
```bash
# Railway will auto-detect the Dockerfile.railway and use it
# Just trigger a new deployment in Railway dashboard
```

### **Option B: Manual Railway CLI** 
```bash
# If you have Railway CLI installed
railway up --dockerfile Dockerfile.railway
```

## 🔧 **Environment Variables Required**

Set these in your Railway project:
```bash
# Required for MCP Services
NOTION_API_KEY=your_notion_key
GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_github_token
METRICOOL_USER_TOKEN=your_metricool_token
METRICOOL_USER_ID=your_metricool_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_google_refresh_token

# Railway sets these automatically
PORT=auto_assigned_by_railway
RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT_NAME=production
RAILWAY_SERVICE_NAME=mcp-gateway
```

## 🎯 **Testing the Fix**

After deployment, your Railway service should be accessible at:
```bash
# Health check (should show all services)
https://your-railway-app.railway.app/health

# Service discovery
https://your-railway-app.railway.app/services

# Individual MCP services
https://your-railway-app.railway.app/notion/
https://your-railway-app.railway.app/github/
https://your-railway-app.railway.app/metricool/
```

## 🐛 **Debugging Tools**

The enhanced health endpoint now shows:
- ✅ Individual service status (healthy/unhealthy/unreachable)
- 🌐 Railway environment information  
- 🔌 Port configurations
- ⏱️ Service response times

## 📊 **Port Architecture** 

```
Railway External: https://app.railway.app (Railway assigned PORT)
├── Gateway: 0.0.0.0:$PORT (public)
└── Internal MCP Services:
    ├── Notion: localhost:3001
    ├── GitHub: localhost:3002  
    ├── Filesystem: localhost:3003
    ├── Metricool: localhost:3004
    └── Google Drive: localhost:3007
```

## 🎉 **Expected Results**

After deployment:
1. **Gateway Starts**: Binds to `0.0.0.0:$PORT` correctly
2. **All Services Launch**: Each MCP service starts on its internal port
3. **Health Checks Pass**: `/health` shows all services as healthy
4. **MCP Requests Work**: Claude can connect to all MCP tools
5. **Railway Logs Clear**: No more port binding errors

The fixes are now committed to your repository. **Trigger a Railway redeploy** and your MCP Gateway should work perfectly! 🚀
